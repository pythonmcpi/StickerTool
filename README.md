# StickerTool
A simple sticker tool.

## Warning!
There is currently a
major bug in the
development version
that breaks the tool.
(The bug blits the
sticker in the wrong
place, so the tool
doesn't work

This sticker tool was made by PythonMCpi. It was designed for private use, but that awesome dude decided to make this open-source.

History:

V1.0 was done before this project was added to GitHub. It is extremely messy, and it was literally thrown together in ~1 hour.
V2.0 (planned @ time of commit) will add an actual user interface and menu, rewrite the image stiching, and add zooming features.
V3.0 (not planned) ???
